<h2>Full Stack Survery Web Application</h2>

<p>This project was completed in 2020 as part of React Full Stack Development instructed by Stephen Grider, who have taught over 1 million students worldwide on Udemy</p>

<p>Throughout the project, I had gained a lot of experience with React, Redux, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Google Oauth and SendGrid API. The good part is to see all the technologies work together to allow users to:
<ul>
 <li>Sign up/in an account</li>
 <li>Pay for their own in-app credit</li>
 <li>Send a campaign to a big list of specified users to collect feedbacks</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to download the project for further review</p>
